# libft_tests

Clone repository to libft project folder

`git clone https://github.com/Jayne-Marko/libft_tests.git tests`

In terminal go to libft project folder and run test.sh
`./tests/test.sh`

You can run files separately using the command like:

`cc tests/test_ft_strlcat.c ft_strlcat.c`

**!** You need to have **Makefile** to run test.sh

**!!** You need to have file **libft.h** with function prototypes to run separate tests.
